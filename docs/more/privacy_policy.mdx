## Information Collection and Use

We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in an open and transparent manner while complying with the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. We do **NOT** request Restricted and Sensitive Scopes from Google. For more information, please visit [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy).

### Information from your Google/GitHub account that we store:

Personal information is stored for as long as your account in Software is active.

We collect this information in order to facilitate the specific functionalities of the Software, including:

If you sign up to receive our news, offers, events or other initiatives regarding our service or other services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and access your name to provide you with our updates in line with any preferences you have told us about. You can unsubscribe from our updates at any time by emailing support@nomadicml.com.

We do not share any information from your Google/GitHub accounts with any third parties.

We do not collect any non-personal information from sign-in service providers, such as Google and GitHub.

Non-Personal Information is collected to further enhance the Software's functionality and user experience. Your data is accessed and used strictly in accordance with the functionalities you engage within the Software.

## Third-Party Data Sharing and User Consent

In order to provide enhanced functionalities within the NomadicML Software, we share certain data with third-party services. Specifically, user-uploaded datasets and logs are stored in databases, and cached in-memory on AWS EC2 instances.

Importantly, when your pipelines or evaluations use third-party model providers, we share the execution data with those providers, and it is then handled according to their privacy policies, as if you perform the same call without or bypassing NomadicML.

Before sharing data with these third-party tools, we ensure to:

- Clearly describe the nature of data being shared and the purpose of such sharing within our privacy policy and user interface.
- Provide users with the option to opt-out of data sharing with third-party services at any time, ensuring users have full control over their data and its privacy.
- Thoroughly de-personalize the data to ensure no personal information is shared with the third parties.

We are committed to upholding the privacy and security of our users' data, in alignment with Google's privacy standards and requirements for apps that interact with third-party tools.

## Security and Data Storage

We prioritize the security of your information through robust data management and security protocols. Uploaded data is stored encrypted in our databases.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or regulatory requirements. We encourage you to review this page regularly to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.

## Limited Use Disclosure

Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. This Software's access, use, storage, and sharing of Google user data are strictly limited to the scope of functionality described in this privacy policy and with your explicit consent.

## Data Deletion Request

We will only retain your personal information for as long as we need it. We consider the nature, sensitivity and purpose we collected your data for when deciding when it's time to delete it. We will in some cases keep your data for longer periods of time than necessary for the original purpose we collected it for if we need to do this to meet our legal, accounting or regulatory requirements.
