## Overview

Welcome to Nomadic Cookbooks. Here you'll find sample code and guides for the most common Nomadic applications. Most code examples are written in Python.

### Install Nomadic

To run these locally, you'll need to install the Nomadic SDK, as below:
```bash
pip install nomadic
``` 

To sync results with the Nomadic Workspace, you'll need a Nomadic account and an associated API key.

<Note> The Nomadic Workspace is coming soon! Until then, please check out the [Workspace demo](demo.nomadicml.com). </Note>
