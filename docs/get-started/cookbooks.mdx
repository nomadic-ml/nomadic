## Overview

Welcome to Nomadic Cookbooks. Here you'll find sample code and guides for the most common Nomadic applications. Most code examples are written in Python.

### Install Nomadic

To run these, you'll need a Nomadic account and associated API key.

<Note> As `nomadic` is currently being developed, it is not yet published into PyPI. The [current `nomadic` PyP package](https://pypi.org/project/nomadic/) is a temporary placeholder. </Note>

Install `nomadic` with the `pip` wheel provided by the Nomadic team as below:

```bash
pip install nomadic-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```
