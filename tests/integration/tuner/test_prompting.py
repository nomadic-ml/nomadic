 {'query': 'Highlight the parts (if any) of this contract related to "Non-Transferable License" that should be reviewed by a lawyer. Details: Does the contract limit the ability of a party to transfer the license being granted to a third party?',
  'context': '"2. ENDORSEMENT AND GRANT OF RIGHTS. During the Contract Period: ... c) The License Rights are exclusive to Berkshire and may not be assigned or in any way conveyed by Berkshire without Auriemma\'s express written consent, except in the event of a merger by Berkshire with another entity offering Banking Services."\n\nThis excerpt highlights the non-transferability of the license granted to Berkshire. The license is exclusive to Berkshire and cannot be assigned or conveyed without Auriemma\'s express written consent, with the exception of a merger with another entity offering banking services. This means that Berkshire cannot transfer the license to a third party without Auriemma\'s approval, limiting Berkshire\'s ability to transfer the license.',
  'response': 'Based on the provided excerpt, here are the key parts of the contract related to "Non-Transferable License" that a lawyer should review:\n\n1. **"The License Rights are exclusive to Berkshire"**: This sentence clearly states that the license is exclusive to Berkshire, which means it cannot be used by any other party without Berkshire\'s permission.\n\n2. **"may not be assigned or in any way conveyed by Berkshire without Auriemma\'s express written consent"**: This is the core provision that makes the license non-transferable. It prohibits Berkshire from assigning or conveying the license to any third party without Auriemma\'s explicit, written agreement. A lawyer would need to ensure that this provision aligns with the parties\' intentions and local laws.\n\n3. **"except in the event of a merger by Berkshire with another entity offering Banking Services"**: This is an exception to the non-transferability rule. It allows Berkshire to transfer the license in the event of a merger with another entity that offers banking services. A lawyer would need to review this exception to ensure it is clear, reasonable, and does not inadvertently create other issues or liabilities.\n\nHere are some details a lawyer would consider while reviewing these parts:\n\n- **Clarity and Ambiguity**: Ensure the language is clear and unambiguous to avoid potential disputes. For instance, the term "conveyed" could be interpreted broadly, so it might be helpful to specify the types of transfers prohibited (e.g., assignment, sublicense, etc.).\n\n- **Compliance with Local Laws**: The lawyer should ensure that the non-transferability provision complies with applicable laws, such as those governing intellectual property, contracts, and business entities.\n\n- **Reasonableness and Enforceability**: The lawyer should assess whether the non-transferability provision is reasonable and enforceable. For example, a court might refuse to enforce a provision that is overly broad or restrictive.\n\n- **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: The lawyer should review any penalties or remedies for breach of the non-transferability provision to ensure they are fair and reasonable.\n\n- **Interaction with Other Provisions**: The lawyer should ensure that the non-transferability provision does not conflict with other provisions in the contract, such as those related to change of control, assignment, or termination.\n\nIn summary, a lawyer should review these parts of the contract to ensure they accurately reflect the parties\' intentions, comply with applicable laws, and are clear, reasonable, and enforceable.',

A questionnaire designed to assess attitudes to headgear was administered to 63 players from four different Canadian teams, each representing a different level of play (high school, university, community club, national). In addition, coaches from all four levels were questioned about team policies and their personal opinions about the use of headgear to prevent concussion. Although the players tended to believe that the headgear could prevent concussion (62%), the coaches were less convinced (33%). Despite the players\' belief that headgear offers protection against concussion, only a minority reported wearing headgear (27%) and few (24%) felt that its use should be made mandatory. Common reasons for not wearing headgear were "its use is not mandatory", "it is uncomfortable", and "it costs too much".',

This provides an effective way to ensure that all traffic to and from the IBM HTTP Server is encrypted over the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) without having to use individual redirects or hard-coded HTTPS links. \nNote: The web server should already be configured to handle HTTPS requests successfully\nbefore attempting to implement the following suggestions. For assistance with setting up SSL in the IBM HTTP Server, visit SSL guide [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179559]\n\nFirst, make sure the LoadModule line for mod_rewrite is uncommented in the httpd.conf\n\nLoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so\n\nNext, add the following to the global scope or any port 80 VirtualHost stanzas defined within the httpd.conf configuration file.\n\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} =80\nRewriteRule ^(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]\n\nFinally, restart the IBM HTTP Server after making the preceding changes\n\nImportant: If using HTTP authentication, make sure it is only configured for your SSL virtual host. If it also applies to your port 80 requests, the authentication challenge can pre-empt the rewrite, resulting in user IDs and passwords being sent over an unencrypted session.\n\nIt is also recommended that you configure your port 80 virtual host with a different document root and so on, from your SSL virtual host. This is to be sure that even if your rewrite fails, sensitive information cannot be served from that virtual host over unencrypted sessions.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Module mod_rewrite..URL Rewriting Engine [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html]',
  'response': "Certainly! Calling a stored procedure that returns multiple rows and columns in IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (WTX) can be a bit tricky, especially given the limitations with certain data types like SYS_REFCURSOR. Here's a general approach to achieve this:\n\n### Steps to Call a Stored Procedure in WTX\n\n1. **Redesign the Stored Procedure**:\n   Since SYS_REFCURSOR is not supported, you need to redesign your stored procedure to return data in a way that WTX can handle. One common approach is to use OUT parameters or temporary tables.\n\n2. **Create a Temporary Table**:\n   You can create a temporary table within your stored procedure to hold the result set. Then, you can select from this temporary table in your WTX map.\n\n3. **Use OUT Parameters**:\n   Another approach is to use OUT parameters to return the data. However, this might be less efficient for large datasets.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's assume you have a stored procedure that returns multiple rows and columns. Here's how you can redesign it:\n\n#### Original Stored Procedure (with SYS_REFCURSOR)\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_data (p_cursor OUT SYS_REFCURSOR) IS\nBEGIN\n  OPEN p_cursor FOR\n    SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM your_table;\nEND;\n```\n\n#### Redesigned Stored Procedure (with Temporary Table)\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_data IS\nBEGIN\n  -- Create a temporary table\n  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table (column1 TYPE, column2 TYPE, column3 TYPE) ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS';\n\n  -- Insert data into the temporary table\n  INSERT INTO temp_table (column1, column2, column3)\n  SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM your_table;\nEND;\n```\n\n#### Calling the Stored Procedure in WTX\n\n1. **Create a Database Connection**:\n   Ensure you have a database connection set up in WTX that points to your Oracle database.\n\n2. **Create a SQL Activity**:\n   In your WTX map, create a SQL activity that calls the stored procedure.\n\n3. **Select from the Temporary Table**:\n   After calling the stored procedure, create another SQL activity to select data from the temporary table.\n\n#### Example SQL Activities\n\n1. **Call the Stored Procedure**:\n   ```sql\n   BEGIN\n     get_data;\n   END;\n```\n\n2. **Select from the Temporary Table**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM temp_table;\n```\n\n### Mapping the Output\n\n1. **Create Output Fields**:\n   In your WTX map, create output fields that correspond to the columns in your temporary table.\n\n2. **Map the Data**:\n   Map the data from the SQL activity that selects from the temporary table to the output fields.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  Make sure to include error handling in your stored procedure and WTX map to handle any exceptions that might occur.\n\n- **Performance Considerations**:\n  Using temporary tables can have performance implications, especially with large datasets. Ensure that your database is optimized for such operations.\n\n- **Documentation**:\n  Refer to the official IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender documentation for more detailed information on SQL activities and database connections.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to call a stored procedure that returns multiple rows and columns in WTX and map the results to the output.",
