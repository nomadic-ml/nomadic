### 2. Define RAG Hyperparameters for the Experiments

Say we want to explore (all of!) the following hyperparameters and search spaces to optimize a RAG performance:

| Parameter                     | Search Space                                                   | Pipeline Stage |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **chunk_size**          | 128, 256, 512                                                          | Retrieval      |
| **top_k**               | 1, 3, 5                                                                | Retrieval      |
| **overlap**             | 50, 100, 150                                                           | Retrieval      |
| **similarity_threshold**| 0.5, 0.7, 0.9                                                          | Retrieval      |
| **embedding_model**     | "text-embedding-ada-002", "text-embedding-curie-001"                   | Retrieval      |
| **model_name**          | "gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4"                                               | Both           |
| **temperature**         | 0.3, 0.7, 0.9                                                          | Inference      |
| **max_tokens**          | 300, 500, 700                                                          | Inference      |
| **retrieval_strategy**  | "sentence-window", "full-document"                                     | Retrieval      |
| **reranking_model**     | true, false                                                            | Inference      |
| **query_transformation**| "rephrasing", "HyDE", "sub-queries"                                    | Both           |

Then, define the search spaces for each RAG pipeline hyperparameter you want to experiment with.

```python
chunk_size = tune.choice([256, 512])
temperature = tune.choice([0.1, 0.9])
overlap = tune.choice([25])
similarity_threshold = tune.choice([50])
top_k =  tune.choice([1, 2])
max_tokens = tune.choice([100, 200])
model_name = tune.choice(["gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4o"])
embedding_model = tune.choice(["text-embedding-ada-002", "text-embedding-curie-001"])
retrieval_strategy = tune.choice(["sentence-window", "auto-merging"])
```

### 3. Upload Evaluation Dataset and External Data

```python
eval_json = {
    "queries": {
        "query1": "Describe the architecture of convolutional neural networks.",
        "query2": "What are the ethical implications of AI in healthcare?",
    },
    "responses": {
        "query1": "Convolutional neural networks consist of an input layer, convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and an output layer.",
        "query2": "Ethical implications include issues of privacy, autonomy, and the potential for bias, which must be carefully managed to avoid harm.",
    }
}
pdf_url = "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sbko6nyzsuw00f2nhxa38/CS229_Lecture_Notes.pdf?rlkey=pebhb2qrdh08bnyxtus8qm11v&st=yha4ikm2&dl=1"

```
### Evaluation Metrics for Retrieval and Inference

In this demo, we use specialized evaluation metrics that work specifically well for the retrieval / inferencing stages of a RAG.
#### A. Retrieval Evaluation Metrics

- **BM25 Scoring:**
  - BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. It considers term frequency (TF), inverse document frequency (IDF), document length, and other factors to compute a score. The BM25 score is used to rank the documents retrieved based on their relevance to the transformed queries. The best-retrieved documents are determined by their BM25 scores.

- **Average Retrieval Score:**
  - The average score is calculated as the mean of the BM25 scores for the best retrieval results across different queries. This score provides a measure of how well the retrieval process is performing overall.

- **Retrieval Time (in milliseconds):**
  - The total time taken to retrieve the documents is measured in milliseconds. This metric helps to evaluate the efficiency of the retrieval process, particularly in terms of speed.

#### B. Inference Evaluation Metric

- **Hallucination Score:**
  - This metric assesses the extent to which the generated response includes information not found in the context. It calculates the proportion of the predicted response tokens that match tokens found in the provided context. The score is computed as:

  `Hallucination Score = 1 - (Matching Tokens / Total Predicted Tokens)`

  - A lower hallucination score indicates that the generated response closely aligns with the provided context, while a higher score suggests the presence of hallucinated (incorrect or fabricated) information.




### 4. Run the Retrieval Experiment! üöÄ
```python
# Obtain RAG inputs
docs, eval_qs, ref_response_strs = obtain_rag_inputs(pdf_url=pdf_url, eval_json=eval_json)

# Run retrieval experiment
experiment_retrieval = Experiment(
    param_fn=run_retrieval_pipeline,
    param_dict={
        "top_k": top_k,
        "model_name": model_name,
        "retrieval_strategy": retrieval_strategy,
        "embedding_model": embedding_model
    },
    fixed_param_dict={
        "docs": docs,
        "eval_qs": eval_qs[:10],
        "ref_response_strs": ref_response_strs[:10],
    },
)

# After the retrieval is done
retrieval_results = experiment_retrieval.run(param_dict={
        "top_k": top_k,
        "model_name": model_name,
        "retrieval_strategy": retrieval_strategy,
        "embedding_model": embedding_model
    })
save_run_results(retrieval_results, "run_results.json")
```

### 5. Run the Inferencing Experiment! üöÄ
```python
# Load the saved results and get the best run result
loaded_results = load_run_results("run_results.json")
best_run_result = get_best_run_result(loaded_results)
best_retrieval_results = best_run_result['metadata'].get("best_retrieval_results", [])

# Run inference experiment
experiment_inference = Experiment(
    param_fn=run_inference_pipeline,
    params={"temperature","model_name", "max_tokens", "reranking_model", "similarity_threshold"},
    fixed_param_dict={
        "best_retrieval_results": best_run_result['metadata'].get("best_retrieval_results", []),
        "ref_response_strs": ref_response_strs[:10],  # Make sure this matches the number of queries used in retrieval
    },
)

inference_results = experiment_inference.run(param_dict={
    "model_name": model_name,
    "temperature": temperature,
    "max_tokens": max_tokens,
    "reranking_model": "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2",
    "similarity_threshold": 0.7,
})
```

### 6. Interpret Results

Now we visualize the retrieval score (for the best run result) along with the inferencing scores for different configurations.

```python
create_retrieval_heatmap(retrieval_results)
```

![Retrieval Results](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91e8d760-c301-427b-975c-44520a21e22d)

Here are the results using the best-performing parameter configuration:

```python
create_inference_heatmap(inference_results)
```
